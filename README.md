# λ-eval #

This project is intended to produce an evaluator/interpreter for the
λ-calculus. So far, the types that comprise the abstract syntax tree and the
methods that transform it appear to be reasonably complete.

Currently, work is on a parser, both the structure and the interface of which
are as yet undecided. Thus, it might take quite long.
